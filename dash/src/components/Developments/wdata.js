      "answer": "A semaphore is a variable used to control access to shared resources. Binary semaphores take values 0 or 1, and counting semaphores can take larger values. For example, if five threads want to access a printer but only two can print at a time, a counting semaphore initialized to 2 will allow only two threads to enter the critical section while others wait."

      "title": "What is a mutex?",
      "answer": "A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a locking mechanism that allows only one thread to access a resource at a time. Itâ€™s used to avoid race conditions. For example, if two threads try to write to the same log file simultaneously, a mutex ensures that one thread locks the file while writing, and the other waits until the lock is released."

      "title": "What is a deadlock?",
      "answer": "A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are waiting on each other for resources, and none can proceed. For example, if Process A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2, while Process B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1, both processes are stuck and cannot continue â€” this is a deadlock."

      "title": "What are the four necessary conditions for a deadlock?",
      "answer": "1. Mutual Exclusion\n2. Hold and Wait\n3. No Preemption\n4. Circular Wait\n\nFor example, in a printing system, if one process holds a scanner and waits for a printer, while another holds the printer and waits for the scanner, all four conditions can be met, leading to a deadlock where neither process can proceed."

    {
      "title": "How to handle deadlocks?",
      "answer": "1. Prevention or avoidance\n2. Detection and recovery\n3. Ignore the problem (used in Windows/Unix)\n\nFor example, in prevention, the system may deny a process from holding one resource while waiting for another. In avoidance, it checks if granting a resource could lead to deadlock. In detection and recovery, the system allows deadlocks to occur but detects and breaks them, while some systems like Windows often just ignore them assuming they are rare."

      "title": "What is Banker's Algorithm?",
      "answer": "It is a deadlock avoidance method that allocates resources only if the system remains in a safe state after allocation. For example, before allowing a process to use more memory, the Banker's Algorithm checks if enough resources will still be available for all other processes to complete safely, just like a banker only lends money if theyâ€™re sure all clients can repay without going bankrupt."

      "title": "What is memory management?",
      "answer": "It refers to managing a computer's memory effectively among different processes using techniques like swapping, paging, segmentation, and allocation strategies. For example, when you open multiple applications on your computer, the operating system uses memory management to allocate RAM efficiently so that each app runs smoothly without interfering with others."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is paging?",
      "answer": "Paging divides memory into equal-sized pages and frames. Logical addresses are mapped to physical addresses, reducing external fragmentation. For example, when a program is loaded into memory, it is split into fixed-size pages that can be stored in any available memory frames, making memory usage more efficient and avoiding gaps caused by different process sizes."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is segmentation?",
      "answer": "Segmentation divides memory into variable-size segments based on logical divisions like functions or data structures. For example, a program may have separate segments for code, data, and stack, allowing each to grow independently and making it easier to manage and protect different parts of the program."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is a page fault?",
      "answer": "A page fault occurs when a process accesses a page that is not currently in physical memory. For example, if a program tries to read data that has been swapped out to disk, the operating system pauses the program, loads the required page from disk into RAM, and then resumes execution."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What are page replacement algorithms?",
      "answer": "1. FIFO\n2. Optimal\n3. LRU\nThese algorithms decide which page to remove from memory when a new page needs to be loaded. For example, in FIFO (First-In-First-Out), the oldest loaded page is removed first. In LRU (Least Recently Used), the page that hasnâ€™t been used for the longest time is replaced, which helps improve efficiency in many real-world applications."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is Beladyâ€™s Anomaly?",
      "answer": "It is a situation where increasing the number of page frames results in more page faults using FIFO algorithm. For example, in some cases, a program may experience fewer page faults with 3 frames than with 4 frames when using FIFO, which is counterintuitive and highlights inefficiency in the algorithm."

      "title": "What is disk scheduling?",
      "answer": "It is the method used by the OS to determine the order of servicing disk I/O requests to improve efficiency. For example, if multiple read/write requests are made to different parts of a hard drive, disk scheduling algorithms like SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) or SCAN are used to decide the optimal order, reducing the total movement of the disk arm and improving performance."

    {
      "title": "What are disk scheduling algorithms?",
      "answer": "1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)\n2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)\n3. SCAN\n4. CSCAN (Circular SCAN)\n5. LOOK\n6. CLOOK (Circular LOOK)\n\nFor example, SSTF selects the disk I/O request that is closest to the current head position, reducing seek time. SCAN moves the disk arm in one direction servicing requests until it reaches the end, then reverses, like an elevator."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is thrashing?",
      "answer": "Thrashing occurs when too many pages are swapped in and out of memory, reducing CPU utilization significantly. For example, if multiple programs are running and each frequently accesses data not currently in RAM, the system spends more time swapping pages than executing processes, causing performance to drop drastically."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is virtual memory?",
      "answer": "Virtual memory is a technique that enables processes to execute even when they donâ€™t fit entirely in physical memory, using disk as extension. For example, if your computer runs out of RAM while opening a large application, it moves some inactive data to disk (swap space) to free up RAM, allowing the program to continue running smoothly."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is fragmentation?",
      "answer": "Fragmentation is inefficient use of memory.\n- Internal: Wasted space inside allocated memory.\n- External: Wasted space between allocated blocks.\n\nFor example, if a program is allocated 100 KB but only uses 70 KB, the remaining 30 KB is internal fragmentation. If several small free memory blocks exist between allocated areas but none are large enough for a new process, thatâ€™s external fragmentation."

    {
      "title": "What is spooling?",
      "answer": "Spooling is a process of storing data temporarily for devices like printers. It queues the jobs to manage access efficiently. For example, when you print multiple documents, the OS stores them in a spool (buffer) and sends them one by one to the printer, allowing you to continue working while printing happens in the background."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is starvation?",
      "answer": "Starvation happens when a process waits indefinitely for a resource because other higher priority processes are continuously allocated those resources. For example, in priority scheduling, if low-priority processes keep getting skipped because high-priority ones keep arriving, the low-priority process may never get CPU time, leading to starvation."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is aging?",
      "answer": "Aging is a technique used to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes over time. For example, if a low-priority process has been waiting in the queue for a long time, the system increases its priority so it eventually gets CPU time, ensuring fairness in scheduling."

      "title": "What is a monolithic kernel?",
      "answer": "A monolithic kernel contains all the essential services in a single large block of code running in a single address space. For example, operating systems like Linux use a monolithic kernel where device drivers, file system management, and memory management all run in kernel mode, offering high performance but potentially lower modularity."
    },    
    {
      "title": "What is a microkernel?",
      "answer": "A microkernel contains only the essential services and runs most services in user space, improving modularity and security. For example, in microkernel-based systems like Minix or QNX, only core functions like communication and scheduling run in kernel mode, while device drivers and file systems run in user space, making the system more stable and easier to maintain."

    {
      "title": "What is logical vs physical address?",
      "answer": "Logical address is generated by the CPU. Physical address is the actual location in memory where data is stored. For example, when a program runs, it uses logical addresses, which are translated by the memory management unit (MMU) into physical addresses in RAM."

      "answer": "Express provides a **default error-handling middleware** that is automatically triggered when `next(err)` is called in any middleware or route.\n\n**How it works:**\n- If any middleware or route calls `next(error)`, Express skips all remaining middleware and routes.\n- It invokes the built-in error handler, which sends a response with **status code 500** (Internal Server Error) and the error message (in development mode).\n\n**Example:**\n```js\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  const err = new Error('Something went wrong');\n  next(err);\n});\n```\n\n**Default behavior:**\n- In production, the default error handler hides the stack trace.\n- In development, it includes stack trace in the response.\n\n**Note:**\n- You can define your **custom error handler** by creating middleware with 4 parameters: `(err, req, res, next)`."

Importing a third-party package:\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\n```\n\n**When to use `require()` vs `import`:**\n- Use **`require()`**:\n  - In **CommonJS** modules (default in Node.js)\n  - When using older versions of Node.js\n  - In `.js` files **without** `type  : module` in `package.json`\n\n- Use **`import`**:\n  - In **ES Modules (ESM)**\n  - When using modern, top-level `await`, or static imports\n  - In `.mjs` files or `.js` files **with** `type : module` in `package.json`\n\n**Note:**\n- Both `require()` and `import` are used for module loading, but they belong to different module systems (CommonJS vs ES Module).\n- You can't mix them freely unless using dynamic import (`import()`), which returns a promise."

      "answer": "`module.exports` is a special object in Node.js used to **export functions, objects, or variables** from one file so that they can be used in another file using `require()`.\n\n**Purpose:**\n- Enables **modular programming** by allowing code to be split across multiple files.\n\n**Example:**\n```js\n// utils.js\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\nmodule.exports = add;\n```\n```js\n// app.js\nconst add = require('./utils');\nconsole.log(add(2, 3)); // 5\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- In `utils.js`, the `add` function is exported using `module.exports`.\n- In `app.js`, it is imported using `require()`.\n\n**Note:**\n- You can also export multiple items:\n```js\nmodule.exports = { add, subtract };\n```\n- `module.exports` is used in **CommonJS modules**. In ES Modules, you use `export` and `import` instead."
